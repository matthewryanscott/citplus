                             2Room Prompt Format0
 
    The room prompt may be tailored by each user to their individual
tastes. This is done with the "3P0" command, in the format strings
submenu (350) of the main config menu (3.EC0). The format consists
of plain text, with special format codes to represent untypeable characters
or attributes of the system.  The following are the format codes which can
be used:
 
    Code        Meaning
    %r          Name of the current room.
    %e          One or more characters representing the room type:
                    )  =  Hidden room
                    ]  =  Directory room
                    >  =  Normal room
                    :  =  Group room
                    >  =  (appended to above) Window room
    %n          Net prefix
    %h          Name of the current hall.
    %i          Info-line of the current room.
    %t          The current non-verbose time/date, formatted to the user's
                specification (help topic '4TIME0').
    %d          The current verbose time/date, formatted to the user's
                specification (help topic '4TIME0').
    %%          The percent sign ('%').
    ^[a-z]      Control-A through Control-Z. Not all control codes do
                anything.  The only one which serves any real purpose is
                ^A, which indicates the start of an ANSI control sequence
                (help topic '4ANSI0').
    ^^          The caret ('^').
    \n          A carriage return.
    \t          A tab.
    \\          The backslash ('\').
