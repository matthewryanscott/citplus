#LOGIN 'R' command.

Added a REPEAT command to #LOGIN scripts... R then 3 parameters. First
parameter is what to wait for, second is what to send if it's not recieved
in #WAIT_TIMEOUT, third is how many times to retry.
For example, to wait for the string "login:", sending a carriage-return
until you get it, and trying 5 times... then sending your initials and
password, the following script would work:
#LOGIN R "login:" "\r" 5 S "initials;password\r"

***************************************************************************

FredCit Ads stuff:          (thanks fred, you're such a genius)

Added #ADCHANCE and #ADTIME settings for EXTERNAL.CIT

#ADCHANCE is the chance of an ad appearing at the command
(room) prompt.  Use whole numbers in the range of 0-100.  0
disables random ads.

#ADTIME is the number of seconds of idle time before an ad is
shown.  Use whole numbers in the range of 0-100.  0
disables timeout ads.

I recommend either a very low ad percentage (1-5%) or a large number
of ad files (like AD.BLB-AD20.BLB), to prevent user annoyance.
Along the same vein, try not to have too many long ads. For
example, you could have these lines in your external.cit:

    #ADCHANCE 5
    #ADTIME   40

Making the user see an ad 5% of the time after a command, and
automatically if they sit idle for 40 seconds.

***************************************************************************

censor stuff:

/* External.Cit keywords */

#CENSOR_AUTHOR
  Censor all messages from an author.
  If message is entered by this author on your system he will get
  the blurb. Censor.blb.

#CENSOR_TEXT
  Censor any messages that contain this text anywhere in the message buffer,
  this includes titles,surnames,path, etc..

#CENSOR_NODE
  Censor all messages from this node.

There is no set limit on the number CENSOR_??? keywords in EXTERNAL.CIT.

/* Config.Cit keyword */
#CENSOR 0
  Users cannot change their ability to view censored messages in .RC..

#CENSOR 1
  Users may toggle whether or not they can view censored messages.
  In .EC when they toggle this they receive the blurb
  "DISCLAIM.BLB" if it exists.  A carefully worded disclaimer blurb can
  help keep you out of prison.

'*' Toggles censor bit on a message when it is being displayed.
.SU lets you toggle viewing of censored messages.
All censored messages still network.
exclusive messages are never censored.

          ***  Net 1_69 Info ***


  Net 1_69 is net 1_6 with the following mods.

  1. Requesting messages with net ID's.
  -------------------------------------
  1a.  When creating roomrec.tmp.  It retrieves rooms to be requested
from from rooms.cit NET ID field.  It requests every room net ID of rooms
that are shared and that the other node has group access to.
When parsing roomreq it matches requested rooms with netID's instead of
room names.

  1b. When it gets the messages back it scans rooms.cit instead of nodes
cit for rooms to put messages in. to match #'s for incorporation.

  2. How to handle the room field of net messages and moved messages.
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
 2a. When netting out in net 6_9. It compares the room field of the message
to the room name. and if they match then write the NET.ID to the room
field of the message. If they don't match then leaave the room field
of the message alone.

  2b. When netting in it compares the room field of the message against
the net.id. if they don't match, message has been moved, leave the
room field of the message unaltered.  If they match, write the room name
into that field.


    ***  Forwarding to Node Info ***


         92Mar19 09:53:26 From [Wow,] The Gremlin [actually posted.]

   E-mail forwarding to node trash. (first draft). As implemented in Gremcit
.51 for anyone who cares.

  label forward_node;  added to log buffer in ctdl.h. is the node name for
e-mail to be forwarded.

  (conversion program provided (a first))

 Rules for Forwarded net e-mail as implemented so far.

  Recipient = person in the T field.
  Forwardee = person in the F field.


 1. If a message is forwarded to a node.  RECIPIENT on local system sees
message and may respond.

 2. FORWARDEE  on net e-mail does not see message on local system.

 3. On recieving node RECIPIENT does not see message, only FORWARDEE sees it.

 4, When netting in forwarded net E-mail check for existance of FORWARDEE
instead of RECIPIENT.


        the mbfwdhash variable in the message table serves a very limited
function.  Allows RECIPIENT on local system to see forwarded net e-mail. and
allows RECIPIENT to see regular non-netted forwarded e-mail, again local use
only.

  Since mtfwdhash is a local thing only I am thinking I can use the mtomesg
(origin id) field for it and go down to 13 bytes per message.
